JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

Although it opens in a browser, no network connection is needed because the notebook is operating locally.
Jupyter files do not have the .py extension but .ipynb.

With shift-enter you can run a cell (same as run button but quicker).
Continue hitting enter and this will just give you more new lines.
Shortcut keys are listed under Help.

You cannot open the .ipynb file by double-clicking. You have to:
1) launch Anaconda Navigator
2) open the Jupyter Notebook
3) open file in the list

To delete variables in case of errors, you can restart under Kernel.
It will restart the kernel which means you will have to run all cells again.
